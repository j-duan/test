Jinming is now an Assistant Professor within Computer Science at University of Birmingham. He was a Research Associate jointly within Department of Computing & Institute of Clinical Sciences at Imperial College London. There, he has been working closely with Prof. Daniel Rueckert and Prof. Declan P O’Regan, and developed cutting-edge machine learning methods for cardiovascular imaging problems. Prior to that, he acquired his PhD degree in Computer Science at University of Nottingham under the supervision of Dr. Li Bai. His PhD thesis entitled Variational and PDE-based Methods for Image Processing. He was funded by EPSRC over his PhD studies.  Jinming’s research includes deep neural nets, variational methods, partial/ordinary differential equations, numerical optimisation, and finite difference/element methods, with applications to image processing, computer vision and medical imaging analysis. His work has appeared across multiple application publications, including proceedings such as MICCAI, CVPR, ECCV, etc, and journals such as The Lancet, Nature Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, Pattern Recognition, Physics in Medicine and Biology, Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision, Journal of Global Optimisation, etc. He regularly reviews 30+ reputable journals.
